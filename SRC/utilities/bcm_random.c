 *
 * This RNG has been shown to appear fairly random, it is a full period
 * generating function (the sequence uses all of the values available to it up
 * to 2147483647), and can be implemented on any architecture using 32-bit
 * integers. The implementation in this file will not overflow for 32-bit
 * arithmetic, which all modern computers should support.
